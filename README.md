# Fun image sharing app
URL: dasima.netlify.app/  
WIP
## Notes:
There are two methods of generating images:
1. Searching: Uses Google Custom Search API to return images based on search term
2. Random Choice: Right now, the choice feature only lets you choose from a set of locally stored izone images. Soon we will implement related high quality images that come randomly from the internet. 

## Bugs currently fixing: 
1. Sometimes "Any Image" searching returns empty images due to some React issue
2. Resizing the window on the title page can make the rotating diamond overlap the title
